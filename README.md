### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the bike sales of an organisation and how customer demographics affect purchasing behavior. Using a dataset of consumer attributes—such as income, age, commute distance etc—the analysis uncovers how different consumer attributes are related to them buying a bike or not, it helps the business better target potential buyers. I used data from [Alex the Analyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary data set is the "Bike sales data.xlsx" file, containing detail information about bikes purchases and the consumer demographics.

### Tools

- Excel-Data Cleaning, Data Analysis & Visualisation( Pivot Tables)

### Data Cleaning
In this phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data inspection where I checked for spelling errors and if all required information was available.
2. Data cleaning and formatting.( Removing duplicates and regrouping data for easier visualisation)

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the bike sales data to answer the following questions:

1. Who is most likely to purchase a bike based on financial factors?
2. How do commuting habits influence the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
3. What age bracket is more likely to purchase bikes?

### Data Analysis
I analyzed my data using Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel, and I could easily summarize and understand my data. I then visualized the data that I had analyzed using the Pivot Tables with Pivot Charts, which enabled me to see how the different factors contributed to the bike purchasing ability of the consumers.

### Results

The analysis results are summarizes as follows:

The analysis of bike buyers reveals that income, occupation, and commute distance significantly influence purchasing decisions. Higher-income individuals and professionals are more likely to buy bikes, while those commuting between 0-1 miles show a higher preference for cycling. Individuals in the middle-age bracket are also observed to be more inclined to purchasing a bike. Lifestyle factors such as marital status and the number of children also play a role, with single individuals and those with fewer or no children being more inclined to purchase. These insights can help businesses tailor marketing strategies to target high-potential buyers effectively.

### Recommendations

1. Target high-income professionals. Offer premium bike models and financing options.
2. Promote biking for short commutes. Highlight convenience, cost savings, and health benefits.
3. Focus on middle-aged consumers. Design campaigns that appeal to their lifestyle and commuting needs.
4. Attract single individuals and small families. Offer tailored promotions, flexible payment plans, and commuter-friendly bikes.

### Limitations
The study may have overlooked how competing transportation options (e.g., public transit, electric scooters, ride-sharing) could impact demand for biking in the target market.
